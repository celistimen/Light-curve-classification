# Light-curve-classification
For my second dissertation, I worked with Kepler/TESS data to classify stars based on their variability type. 

## Feature extraction
This folder contains a file with minimal code to extract the 24 most effective features for light curve classification, based on tsfresh, TSFEL, and Cesium, using forward feature selection. Additionally, an example is included to show the usage.

## Stellar explorer
I developed a web application to visualize light curves and their features. The code can be found in this folder.
